Node.js & MongoDB API Starter

This project demonstrates how to establish a basic connection between a Node.js application and a MongoDB database, followed by the creation of an API endpoint. It covers the essential steps to configure routes, handle requests, and ensure smooth communication between the server and the database.
Features

    Basic Node.js and MongoDB connection setup
    API endpoint creation
    Route configuration and request handling
    Smooth interaction between Node.js server and MongoDB data store

Technologies Used

    Node.js
    MongoDB

Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-mongo-api-starter.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd node-mongo-api-starter

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up your MongoDB database and provide the connection URI in the .env file.

Start the application:

    npm start
